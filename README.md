# Home Decor API

This Home Decor API is designed to manage a catalog of home decor items, such as furniture, lighting, and accessories. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it allows CRUD operations for managing items by category, location, price, and other details. Itâ€™s ideal for e-commerce platforms and inventory management.

## Features
- Create a new decor item (POST)
- Read all decor items or by ID (GET)
- Update an existing decor item by ID (PUT)
- Delete a decor item by ID (DELETE)

## Technologies
- Node.js and Express for backend logic
- MongoDB with Mongoose for database management
- RESTful API for easy integration
